# Python-Gym-Calculator
A simple python web application that allows a user to input a desired weight, and will output a list of barbell weights to use to get closest to the desired weight. currently uses a list integrated in the app.py file, but I want to make it more easily configurable.

# Ideas 
customizable list
visual adding, drag drop, multiselect
multiple customizable bars (and weight of bar) and weight sets
starred favorite bar
preset weight choices (common weights like 10, 25, 45 etc)
add by plates (user selects plates to add to the barbell and it gives the weight of those)
dark mode
kg switch
remove the '.0' at the end
if not exact, Closest values for below and above desired weight.
visual representation
color customization for weight plates

A way to track the userâ€™s progress and goals, such as a log of previous weights, a graph of weight changes, or a calculator of estimated one-rep max.
